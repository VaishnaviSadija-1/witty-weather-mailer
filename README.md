## 🧪 Why I Built This

This was my **first automation** using n8n — a fun experiment to blend **utility with creativity**.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Integrate APIs into workflows  
- Use scheduled triggers like a Cron job  
- Format dynamic, readable content  
- Automate emails using n8n nodes

It may be a small project, but it taught me a lot and makes my mornings more enjoyable!
